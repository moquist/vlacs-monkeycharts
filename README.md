# vlacs-monkeycharts

These are some relataively simple charts for VLACS, in a terrifically
unifinished state.

## To make it go at this early stage:

1. ```cp config-db-dist.edn config-db.edn```
1. Edit ```config-db.edn``` to have the correct values for your VLACS database.
1. ```rlwrap lein figwheel```
1. http://localhost:3449
  1. Edit the following locations if you need to use a different host and/or port:
  In ```project.clj```, edit :figwheel :server-port.
  In ```dev_src/monkeycharts/dev.cljs```, edit :websocket-url.
